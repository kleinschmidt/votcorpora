# VOT Corpora

This package collects a number of small VOT corpora from different sources:

* Baese-Berk & Goldrick (2009) experiment 1 measured voice onset time for
  monosyllabic words with word-initial voiceless stops. Some words had voiced
  minimal pair, while others did not. Words were read in isolation with other
  monosyllabic fillers that did not have initial stops. Experiment 1a only had
  /p/-initial words, and Experiment 1b had /t/ and /k/.  Supported by National
  Institutes of Health Grant DC0079772

* Goldrick, Vaughn, & Murphy (2013), experiment 1 is analogous to Baese-Berk &
  Goldrick (2009) but with voiced stops.  Supported by National Science
  Foundation Grant BCS0846147

* Allen & Miller (1999). Experiment 1 measured VOTs for voiced and voiceless stops
  in monosyllabic words. Experiment 2 included a subset of word pairs from Experiment
  1 as well as the additional manipulation of speaking rate (fast and slow).
  This research was supported by NIH Grant DC00130 from the National Institute
  on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and by a Minority Fellowship
  from the Acoustical Society of America.

* Lev-Ari, S., & Peperkamp, S. (2013). English-French bilinguals (English L1)
  read 16 sentences, 10 of which contained one word each starting with /p/, /t/,
  and /k/. (Items are the English sentences from Fowler, Sramkoc, Ostrya,
  Rowlanda, & Halle, 2008). A subset of the talkers also conducted interviews,
  from which VOTs of all word-initial voiceless stops were measured.  Supported
  by Fondation Pierre-Gilles de Gennes and Agence Nationale de la Recherche
  (ANR-2010-BLAN-1901, ANR-10-LABX-0087 and ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02).

* Buckeye (Nelson, N. & Wedel, A., _e-pub ahead of print_). VOTs
  automatically annotated from word-initial voice and voiceless stops in the
  Buckeye Corpus of conversational speech by Andy Wedel and Noah Nelson.  Age is
  coded as old (40+) or young (under 40).  Includes stop length and local speech
  rate information, but no pre-voiced tokens.


The first three are from isolated word list reading, the fourth from sentences and
conversational speech and the fifth from conversational speech. All are from
English monolinguals except for the Lev-Ari data, which is from L1 English, L2
French speakers who live in France and speak French primarily. The Buckeye,
Lev-Ari, and Goldrick et al. (2013) have speaker sex coded, and Buckeye and
Lev-Ari have age (Buckeye only as older/younger than 40).

__The only corpora that have both voiced and voiceless stops for each talker are the
Buckeye and Allen & Miller data.__

#>
#> Description:
#>
#>      Word initial VOT measurements from four different production
#>      experiments. Two are isolated word reading, one is sentence
#>      reading, and one is conversational speech from interviews.

#>
#>      subject ID of the talker that produced this observation

#>           extracted.
#>

#>           sonorant onset (Buckeye only), in ms.
#>
#>      voicing Is the phoneme ‘voiced’ or ‘voiceless’.
#>
#>      place Place of articulation. ‘cor’ for coronal, ‘lab’ for labial,
#>           and ‘dor’ for dorsal.
