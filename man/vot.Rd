\title{Combined VOT production data}
\format{A data frame with 14,262 observations of 12 variables:
\describe{
\item{source}{The source of this observation}
\item{subject}{ID of the talker that produced this observation}
\item{phoneme}{Phoneme whose VOT was measured}
\item{final_phoneme}{Final phoneme in the word (\code{allen-miller} only; all
  voiced/voiceless stops)}
\item{vot}{Voice onset time in ms}
\item{vowel_duration}{Duration of the following vowel in ms}
\item{final_closure}{Closure duration of final stop (\code{allen-miller} only).}
\item{final_aspiration}{Duration of release burst of final stop
  (\code{allen-miller} only).}
\item{prevoiced}{For voiced stops, TRUE if prevoicing was present, FALSE if
  not. NA for voiceless stops}
\item{word}{Word that the phoneme occurred in}
\item{sex}{The sex of the talker ('m' or 'f'), NA if missing (\code{bbg09}).}
\item{age}{The age of the talker, NA if missing (\code{bbg09} and
  \code{gva13}).}
\item{age_group}{The age group of the talker ('o' for over 40, and 'y' for
  under 30; based on the Buckeye Corpus scheme).}
\item{bilingual}{TRUE for French-English bilinguals, FALSE for english
  monolinguals}
\item{speech_rate}{The local speech rate (for Buckeye only) in syllables per
  second. This is calculated based on the number of vowels in the continuous
  speech window around the word where VOT was extracted.}
\item{speech_rate_condition}{Allen & Miller (1999) elicited slow and fast
  speech rates in their Experiment 2 by varying the instructions and the time
  that the word was displayed (1500ms for the "slow" rate, and 750ms for the
  "fast" rate)}.
\item{stop_length}{The length of the whole stop, from burst to following
  sonorant onset (Buckeye only), in ms.}
\item{voicing}{Is the phoneme \code{voiced} or \code{voiceless}.}
\item{place}{Place of articulation. \code{cor} for coronal, \code{lab} for
  labial, and \code{dor} for dorsal.}

\description{
Word initial VOT measurements from four different production experiments. Two
are isolated word reading, one is sentence reading, and one is conversational
speech from interviews.

\describe{

\item{bbg09}{Baese-Berk & Goldrick (2009), experiment 1 measured voice onset
  time for monosyllabic words with word-initial voiceless stops. Some words
  had voiced minimal pair, while others did not. Words were read in isolation
  with other monosyllabic fillers that did not have initial stops. Experiment
  1a only had /p/-initial words, and Experiment 1b had /t/ and /k/.}

\item{gva13}{Goldrick, Vaughn, & Murphy (2013), experiment 1 is analogous to
  \code{bbg09} but with voiced stops.}
  
\item{allen-miller}{Allen & Miller (1999). Experiment 1 was similar to
  \code{gva13} and measured VOTs for voiced and voiceless stops in
  monosyllabic words from . Experiment 2 was the same as Experiment 1 but included
  the additional manipulation of speaking rate (fast and slow). Prevoiced
  stops are coded as NA. Since all words were monosyllabic with a final stop
  consonant, the stop consonant phoneme is included (\code{final_phoneme}),
  as is the measurements of closure and aspiration duration
  (\code{final_closure} and \code{final_aspiration}).}

\item{levari-sent}{Lev-Ari, S., & Peperkamp, S. (2013). English-French
  bilinguals (English L1) read 16 sentences, 10 of which contained one word
  each starting with /p/, /t/, and /k/. (Items are the English sentences from
  Fowler, Sramkoc, Ostrya, Rowlanda, & Halle, 2008)}

\item{levari-convo}{A subset of the talkers from \code{levari-sent} conducted
  interviews, from which VOTs of all word-initial voiceless stops were
  measured.}

\item{buckeye}{Nelson, Noah & Wedel, Andrew (under revision).  The phonetic
  specificity of competition: Contrastive hyperarticulation of voice onset
  time in conversational English.  VOTs manually extracted from the Buckeye
  Corpus of conversational speech by Andy Wedel. Age is coded as old (40+) or
  young (under 40).  Includes two measures of local speech rate, syllables
  per second and total stop length.}
